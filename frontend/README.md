# CoursePath â€” Starting Menu UI (Vite + React + TS)

A **fully runnable** front-end preview of the Starting Menu page. Includes:
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS configured
- Minimal UI primitives (no external shadcn dependency)
- All components required are included locally under `src/components/ui`

## Quick Start

Install requirements
```bash
npm install
```

Run Development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown (default http://localhost:5173).

## Notes
- This project ships its own minimal UI components to avoid external setup.
- You can replace them with shadcn/ui later if desired.
